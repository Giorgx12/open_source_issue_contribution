## 🎯 What is this?

`fixit` is a tiny command line toolbox (word counter, unit converter, password generator, JSON formatter, text tools). It is **deliberately imperfect**: some tools have bugs, some tests are missing and some features are not built yet. Every problem is an open [issue](../../issues) you can pick up.

New to open source? This repo is built for you. No experience with big codebases needed.

## 🚀 Make your first contribution in 5 minutes

1. **Pick an issue** with the [`good first issue`](../../labels/good%20first%20issue) label and comment `I'd like to work on this`.
2. **Fork** this repo (top right button) and clone it:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/issue.git
   cd issue
   ```
3. **Set up**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   pytest
   ```
4. **Create a branch**, fix the issue, and remove the matching `xfail` marker in the tests:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix-issue-12
   ```
5. **Run the tests** (`pytest`), commit, push and open a **Pull Request** mentioning `Closes #12`.

## 🧰 Try the tool

```bash
fixit wc "hello world"
fixit convert 100 c2f
fixit password --length 16 --symbols
fixit json '{"name":"fixit"}'
fixit palindrome "Level"
fixit reverse "open source is fun"
```

Some of these will give you wrong answers. That is the point. 😉
